# Design Document for Python Application

## High-Level Functionality
This Python application reads content from two text files (Test1.txt and Test2.txt), processes the data, and outputs the results in a user-friendly format. The application includes functionalities such as data validation, merging of data from both files, and displaying or storing the processed information.

## User Stories

### User Story 1
As a user, I want to read and process data from multiple text files, so that I can aggregate and analyze the information easily.

### User Story 2
As a user, I want to have the processed data displayed in a user-friendly format, so that I can quickly understand the results without needing to manually format the data.

- **Preconditions**: The application prompts the user for input.
- **Postconditions**: Custom file paths are used for reading data.
- **Actors**: User, System
- **Trigger**: User runs the application.
- **Flow**:
  1. The system prompts the user for input file paths.
  2. The user enters custom file paths.
  3. The system reads data from the specified file paths.

### Display Summary Statistics
- **Description**: The system calculates and displays summary statistics (e.g., count, mean, median) of the processed data.
- **Preconditions**: Data is sorted.
- **Postconditions**: Summary statistics are displayed to the user.
- **Actors**: System, User
- **Trigger**: Data sorting is complete.
- **Flow**:
