# Software-Dev-2450

This program simulates a simple machine language computer/UVSim. It reads instructions/BasicML from a file, loads the instructions into memory, and executes them.
Instructions are fed via a text file where each line contains one instruction. The program is read into memory starting at address 0. 

The first two digits of each BasicML instruction are the operation code specifying the operation to be performed, and the last two digits of the BasicML instruction are the operand â€“ the address of the memory location containing the word to which the operation applies.
Below is an example of what an instruction file should look like:

+1007
+1008
+2007
+2008
+2109
+1109
+4300
+0000
+0000
+0000

The available operations are as follows: 

10xx: Read (Input a number into memory location xx)
11xx: Write (Output the number from memory location xx)
20xx: Load (Load the number from memory location xx into the accumulator)
21xx: Store (Store the number from the accumulator into memory location xx)
30xx: Add (Add the number from memory location xx to the accumulator)
31xx: Subtract (Subtract the number from memory location xx from the accumulator)
32xx: Divide (Divide the accumulator by the number from memory location xx)
33xx: Multiply (Multiply the accumulator by the number from memory location xx)
40xx: Branch (Set the instruction counter to xx)
41xx: Branch if negative (Set the instruction counter to xx if the accumulator is negative)
42xx: Branch if zero (Set the instruction counter to xx if the accumulator is zero)
43xx: Halt (Stop the program)

TO RUN THE PROGRAM: Open a terminal and cd into the project folder (project 2450). Ensure that the desired instruction file is in the project folder, 
then run the following command: <python3 program1.py> 

While running the program will continously prompt the user for instruction files until the user presses "q" for quit. Some operations may require user input, follow the prompts to complete each operation.
